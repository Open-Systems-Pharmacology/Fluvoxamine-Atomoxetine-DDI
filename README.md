# Fluvoxamine-Atomoxetine-DDI
Modeling of published fluvoxamine-atomoxetine-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the fluvoxamine and atomoxetine models regarding fluvoxamine-atomoxetine-DDIs, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied models have been published previously [1,2]. The originally published fluvoxamine model [1] was adapted to include competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. The originally published atomoxetine model [2] was adapted to include competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. 

For further details and documentation please refer to [3].
